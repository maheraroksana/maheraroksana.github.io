Hi! I'm an engineering student at University of Dhaka. My research interests are in the realm of computer vision, image processing/analysis, and generative networks. I'm currently working on my final year thesis which is about enhancing segmentation and classification of microbial artifacts using GANs.
<br>
<br>
When I'm not working, I'm either reading, learning math, mastering complex & strategic board games over at [BGA](https://en.boardgamearena.com/), ~~or doomscrolling reddit~~. I'm always looking for new experiences and chasing the thrill of pursuing difficult and meaningful challenges. ✨✨

```python
def caesar(cipher, shift):
    plain = ""
    for letter in cipher:
        dec = chr((ord(letter) - ord('A') - shift + 26) % 26 + ord('A'))
        plain += dec
    return plain
shifts_of_march = 15
cipherScroll = "BPWTGPGXHAPB"
dagger = caesar(cipherScroll, shifts_of_march)
print(dagger.lower())
```
