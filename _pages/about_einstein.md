Hi! I'm an engineering student at University of Dhaka. My research interests are in the realm of medical imaging and deep learning. I'm currently working on my final year thesis which is about enhancing segmentation and classification of microbial artifacts using GANs.

When I'm not working, I'm either reading, learning math, playing board games over at [BGA](https://en.boardgamearena.com/), ~~or doomscrolling reddit~~. I'm always looking for new experiences and chasing the thrill of pursuing difficult and meaningful challenges. ✨✨
